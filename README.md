## Introduction

This project aims to model an aircraft using MATLAB functionalities and visualize it using HTML scripts. The integration of MATLAB with HTML allows for interactive visualization and simulation of the aircraft's flight dynamics.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files:

- `aircraft.html`: HTML script for creating the aircraft model.
- `visualization.html`: HTML script for visualizing the aircraft's flight dynamics.
- `create_aircraft.m`: MATLAB function for generating the aircraft model.
- `simulate_flight.m`: MATLAB function for simulating the aircraft's flight.

## Dependencies

To run the project, you need the following software installed:

- MATLAB
- Web browser with HTML5 support

## Usage

### Setting Up the Environment

1. Clone or download the project repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure MATLAB is installed on your system.
3. Open MATLAB and navigate to the project directory.

### Running the Simulation

1. Run the `create_aircraft.m` MATLAB script to generate the aircraft model.
2. Open `aircraft.html` in a web browser to view and interact with the aircraft model.
3. Run the `simulate_flight.m` MATLAB script to simulate the aircraft's flight.
4. Open `visualization.html` in a web browser to visualize the aircraft's flight dynamics.

## HTML Scripts

### aircraft.html

This HTML script creates the aircraft model using WebGL and allows users to interact with the model using mouse and keyboard inputs.

### visualization.html

This HTML script visualizes the aircraft's flight dynamics using WebGL and provides controls for adjusting simulation parameters such as altitude, speed, and orientation.

## MATLAB Functions

### create_aircraft

This MATLAB function generates the aircraft model based on specified dimensions and parameters. It creates a 3D model of the aircraft using MATLAB's graphics capabilities.

### simulate_flight

This MATLAB function simulates the flight of the aircraft using numerical methods and differential equations. It calculates the aircraft's position, velocity, and orientation over time and outputs the simulation results.
